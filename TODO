The original icon pack uses the same generic icons to represent a multitude of applications. 

1. A music icon (two eighth notes beamed together) to represent 60 audio applications

2. A video icon (a piece of vertical filmstrip) for 52 multimedia video players

3. A BitTorrent icon for 4 bittorrent clients.

If the user has installed many applications of the same type, they appear indistinguishable in an application launcher or an application menu etc.

Each application will have its own distinct icon.
