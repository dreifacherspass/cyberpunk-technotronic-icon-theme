# cyberpunk-technotronic-icon-theme
a blue-purple (oomox) gradient full-icon theme
For all of us that love cyberpunk, neon, outrun, synthwave and retrofuture aesthetics.

**Feel free to ask for new icons**

The theme includes icons from Ultimate-Punk-Suru++ (which hasn't received updates for years), candy-icons and icons provided by the applications.
I am colouring the icons using our beloved blue-purple gradient, so that the icon pack has a uniform look.
