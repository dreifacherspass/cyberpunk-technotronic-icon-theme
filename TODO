1. The original icon pack uses the same generic icons to represent a multitude of applications:

	- A music icon (two eighth notes beamed together) to represent 60 audio applications

	- A video icon (a piece of vertical filmstrip) for 52 multimedia video players

	- A BitTorrent icon for 4 BitTorrent clients.

	- A terminal icon for 42 terminal applications.

2. Applications from different desktops are represented by the same icons
	- web cam apps

	- file managers

	- photo gallery apps

If the user has installed many applications of the same type, they appear indistinguishable in an application launcher or an application menu etc. 

The applications should have their own specific icons.
